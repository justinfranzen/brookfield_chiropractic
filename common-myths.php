 <h1 id="main-header">Common Chiropractic Myths</h1>
    
    <div id="secondary-content">
        
        <p>If chiropractic care seems promising, but you have doubts, join the club. Chiropractic is different. And it is this difference that has brought results to millions since 1895 and caused them to rethink the nature of health and the role of chiropractic care in it.</p>
        
        <p>Once and for all, let’s put to rest some of the most common myths:</p>

                <li><a href="fix-not-broken.php">Don’t fix it if it’s not broken.</a></li>
                <li><a href="medical-doctor-approval.php">My medical doctor wouldn’t approve.</a></li>

            </ul>
            
        </div>
            
            <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">

        <p>If these myths were true, chiropractic would have disappeared long ago, just like bloodletting and countless other ineffective procedures. But not only has chiropractic survived, it’s thriving as more and more people want a safe and natural approach to better health that avoids drugs or surgery.</p>
