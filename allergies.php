        <p><strong>Chiropractic care doesn’t treat allergies.</strong> So, why do so many people with allergies mention that they see improvement by receiving care in our practice?</p>
        
        <h3 class="subheader">It’s Not the Pollen</h3>
        
        <div class="row">
            
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">
        
                 <p>There are many signs of an allergic reaction. Itchy eyes. Runny nose. Sneezing. Skin rash. More serious reactions can include constricted air passageways, vomiting and even death. All this from a handful of peanuts, an encounter with a cat or microscopic grains of pollen in the air!</p>
                
                <p>If <em>everyone</em> reacted to these common substances, we could fix the blame squarely on the nut, dander, shellfish or pollen. But not everyone reacts.</p>
                
                <p>What is it?</p>
                
                <h3 class="subheader">Inappropriate Threat</h3>
    
                <p>Your nervous system is the master system that orchestrates your immune system, glandular system, respiratory system and every other system that reacts inappropriately to an allergen. Normally, these systems help you respond and adapt to the world around you. But suffering from uncontrollable sneezing around a house cat is probably an inappropriate reaction.</p>
            
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
                
               <img src="images/fear-of-allergies.jpg" alt="Allergies" class="interior-img" />
                <figcaption>Your body inappropriately perceives the allergen as a threat.</figcaption>
            
            </div>
            
        </div>
        
        <p>If your nervous system isn’t working right, you don’t work right. So, rather than direct our attention to the countless potential allergens, we locate and reduce the disturbances we find to your nervous system.</p>
        
        <h3 class="subheader">A Full Bucket</h3>
        
        <div class="row">
        
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">
            
                <p>Each of us was born with the capacity to withstand or adapt to stress. If we’re unable to deal with things we eat, breathe or come into contact with it may be because our margin to adapt is used up.</p>
                
                 <p>Pretend that this bucket represents your capacity to adapt to the physical, emotional and chemical stresses of life. Every stressful encounter your body faces, fills up your bucket.</p>
                
                <p>If your bucket is already full and you encounter pollen, foods or other chemicals, your bucket overflows. When that happens, people say they’re having an allergic reaction. But what they’re really saying is, “I’ve lost my ability to adapt. My margin is used up.”</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">

        <h3 class="subheader">Chiropractic: Nervous System</h3>
                
                <p><strong>So, we don’t treat allergies.</strong> We look for ways to restore your ability to adapt to allergens by locating and reducing disturbances to your nervous system. Simple, really.</p>
                
                <p>We’d love to discuss your specific allergy issue and how chiropractic may help.</p>
