        <p>Brookfield chiropractors, Dr. Kevin Herrle and Dr. Matt Christiansen established Brookfield Chiropractic in 2007 after practicing together in Waukesha. We chose our location in Brookfield because of the convenience to the freeway and the central location in a new retail center. We wanted to combine our knowledge and experience to be able to help more people more efficiently.</p>

                 <p>What you see is what you get from our professional, caring staff and doctors. It is our goal to tailor the care to fit the patient, rather than expecting the patient having to fit our style. We will discuss any Finances with you before any charged treatments are rendered.</p>

         <p>We understand that some people have had negative experiences with chiropractic care in other offices. At Brookfield Chiropractic we are continually providing professional, timely, friendly service and healthy positive experiences for our practice members. We like to have fun helping people and are continually finding ways to provide a “wow” experience that includes better and improved health for families in the area. We strive to serve families and nothing satisfies us more as doctors than when a parent entrusts the care of a child with us. We have the opportunity to allow them to grow up the way they should and be healthy. Our area has way too many sick children and we want to make a difference.</p>
                
        <p>We love our family and love what we do. But as you know, life can be devastating when you´re in pain. We care about people, we listen closely, and when we´ve diagnosed your problems, we give you our best.</p>
        
        <p>If you´ve tried other doctors, been on pain medications, and are tired of getting no results, this is how we can help you.</p>
        
        <ul id="number-list">
            <li>We talk to you about your problem.</li>
            <li>Then we take x-rays of the involved areas.</li>
            <li>We then do a comprehensive analysis, then tell you your options.</li>
            <li>If you like the treatment plan, we being.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you don´t think the care plan is for you, we shake hands and part as friends. We want you healthy, happy, and back to normal.</p>
