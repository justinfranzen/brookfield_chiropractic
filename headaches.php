                <p>Pain relievers of various types are the most common approach to headaches. In our practice we take a more natural approach. Our objective is to find and reduce the underlying cause of a headache.</p>
                
                <h3 class="subheader">Hidden Cause</h3>
                
                <p>A common cause of headaches is from spinal bones in the neck that aren’t supporting the head properly. You might not notice your reduced ability to turn your head. But these <a href="">vertebral subluxations</a> affect nerves, muscles and even the blood supply to your head.</p>

                <p>Some are surprised to learn that their headaches are being caused by problems in their lower back! The upper spine compensates, shifting the head off center, causing headaches.</p>

                <p>While we can’t guarantee results, we have a high success rate with practice members who get headaches. Give us a call. Let’s sit down and discuss your unique situation.</p>

        <ul id="questions">
            <button class="accordion question"><li>Is the spine the source of all headaches?</li></button>
                <div class="panel answer">
                    <p>Not necessarily. The three most common causes are physical trauma, emotional stress or chemical toxins. Sometimes there may be a combination of factors. Our examination process helps identify the most likely cause(s).</p>
                </div>
            <button class="accordion question"><li>What causes subluxations?</li></button>
                <div class="panel answer">
                    <p>There are three basic causes of subluxations. Physical causes could include slips and falls, accidents, repetitive motions, and improper lifting. Emotions, such as stress, anger and fear can be the cause of subluxations. Chemical causes could include alcohol, drugs, preservatives, pollution and poor diet.</p>
                </div>
            <button class="accordion question"><li>I was told it was "all in my head." Now what?</li></button>
                <div class="panel answer">
                    <p>The pain you feel is real. And psychological sources of pain are common. However, this “diagnosis” is often the last resort of health practitioners who have exhausted their possible explanations of the cause of your problem. In these cases, we’ve often found that undetected subluxations are likely culprits.</p>
                </div>
           <button class="accordion question"><li>How many visits will it take?</li></button>
                <div class="panel answer">
                    <p>Some practice members enjoy results quickly. Others notice a slow decline in their symptoms after several weeks or longer of chiropractic care. It’s impossible to predict. If you’ve had chronic headaches for many years, improvement can take time. We monitor your progress and modify our recommendations as needed.</p>
                </div>
            <button class="accordion question"><li>What if chiropractic care doesn't help?</li></button>
                <div class="panel answer">
                    <p>If we’re unable to find and correct the cause of your particular health problem, we will refer to other experts who may be able to help. Your health and your satisfaction are our only goal.</p>
                </div>
           <button class="accordion question"><li>Why didn't my medical doctor suggestion chiropractic?</li></button>
                <div class="panel answer">
                    <p>That’s changing. Years of prejudice and bias are giving way to research showing the benefits of chiropractic care. Attitudes are slow to change. However, as the public demands alternatives to drugs and surgery, more and more medical practitioners are referring to chiropractors.</p>
