        <p>Spinal joints that aren’t moving right can choke or irritate nearby nerves. Chiropractic adjustments add motion to these stuck joints, reducing nervous system disruption. Then, health has the best opportunity to return.</p>
        
        <h3 class="subheader">Many Techniques</h3>

                <p>Sometimes a specific, highly-accurate thrust is used. Or an instrument delivers carefully directed energy. Or a slow, constant pressure is used. Several areas may be adjusted, or just one. Sometimes a popping sound is heard.</p>
                
            <h3 class="subheader">Feels Great</h3>
        
                 <p>Because we rely on adjustments to help your body “right itself”, we’re highly proficient.</p>
        
                <p>Most practice members report a sense of well-being and ease. After all, if adjustments weren’t pleasant, our practice members wouldn’t return for the multiple visits needed to retrain their spine!</p>
                
                <h3 class="subheader">Everyone Benefits</h3>
        
        <p>Newborns, infants, children, seniors and even back surgery practice members can get adjusted. Naturally, adjustments are tailored to your size, age and particular health issue.</p>
        
        <p>Find out for yourself by scheduling a no-obligation consultation to discuss your problem.</p>
