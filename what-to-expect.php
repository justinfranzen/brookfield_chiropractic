         <p>As chiropractors in Brookfield we want all of our patients to feel immediately at home when they walk in the door. Since chiropractic care involves a series of visits, with each one building on the ones before, it’s important for you to feel comfortable right from the start.</p>
        
            <h3 class="statement lightblue">Your First Visit to Our Brookfield Practice</h3>

                        <p>For some people, the first thoughts they have about seeing a chiropractor can make them feel uneasy. There are lots of myths and pre-conceived notions as to what happens at a chiropractic office, but our caring staff will make you feel at ease from the moment you enter our office!</p>

                        <p>Of course there is necessary paperwork that needs to be filled out so our doctors can properly address your health concerns, but we have some of it available on our website to save you valuable time in our office. If you haven’t already forwarded us your insurance information, we ask that you bring your card to your appointment so that we may verify coverage with us. Remember that the consultation is a free service we offer with no obligation for treatment, so you’ve got nothing to lose.</p>
                        
                        <p>During the consultation you will talk with our doctors and discuss your needs and concerns. The purpose of the consultation with the doctor is to discuss your health goals and see if chiropractic is likely to help you. If it looks promising, a thorough examination will help identify the cause of your problem. We may need to perform x-rays to further visualize and analyze your condition, but we use the latest in safe high speed digital x-ray technology.</p>

                <h3 class="subheader">Chiropractors in Brookfield Explain Everything First</h3>

                <p>Our patients appreciate that we explain everything in advance. We usually ask that patients allow for at least an hour to perform the initial evaluation, but this time frame varies from person to person. If your condition is an acute one, or you are in extreme pain, the doctor may perform treatment on the first visit to give you relief, but this is done at the doctor’s discretion. After your first visit is complete, you will proceed to the front desk to schedule your next appointment, where the doctor will go over the cause of your condition.</p>
                
                <h3 class="subheader">Your Second Visit to Brookfield Chiropractic</h3>

                <p>After we study your health history and correlate our examination findings, we’ll make recommendations designed to help you regain and keep your health. We call this the Report of Findings. This two-visit approach accomplishes several things:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduces the length of your first visit</li>
                    <li>Gives us time to correlate our findings</li>
                    <li>Avoids overloading you with too much information</li>              
                </ul>
                
                <p>We ask that patients allow for about an hour for this visit and that you bring along your spouse or significant other, so that they too will understand your condition and our approach to treatment. If everything is explained to your satisfaction and makes sense to you, then we will proceed with your first treatment. You will be told what you can expect during the treatment, as well as what you might experience throughout the treatment process. Suggestions will be made for self-treatment that the doctor may recommend to help speed up your recovery.</p>

                        <p>A typical office visit may require just 15 to 30 minutes. We recognize your time is valuable, so we do everything possible to run on schedule and minimize the impact on your busy life.</p>

                        <p>We certainly don’t want you to think the length of a regular visit lessens its value! With the groundwork laid, our Doctors can quickly assess the current condition of your spine and nervous system, adjust you, and get you on your way.</p>

                        <p>Like a regular workout at the gym, each visit builds on the ones before. Miss a visit and you can lose the momentum necessary to make needed changes.</p>
                        
                        <p>We do everything possible to make you comfortable and relaxed prior to your adjustments to achieve maximum effectiveness.</p>
