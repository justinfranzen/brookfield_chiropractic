                <p>Estimates suggest that up to 90% of women suffer from some form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) with 10 -20% experiencing severe or disabling symptoms.</p>
                
                <p>If you’re resolved not to give in to menstrual or premenstrual discomfort, and you want a natural solution that avoids drugs, many women turn to chiropractic.</p>
                
                 <h3 class="subheader">The Lumbar Spine</h3>
        
                <p>Your nervous system controls and regulates every cell, tissue, organ and system of your body. The spine, especially in the lower back, can impair nerves that direct and monitor the reproductive and hormonal systems.</p>

                <figcaption>It’s not all in your head! If there’s evidence of nerve compromise to your reproductive organs, chiropractic care may help.</figcaption>

        <p>Could undetected vertebral subluxations be involved in other female health issues? More research is needed. However, our experience suggests that this would be fertile ground for more investigation.</p>
        
        <h3 class="subheader">The Effects</h3>
        
        <p>We typically see three types of effects which may be symptoms of nervous system disregulation.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Over activity</strong> – such as heavy bleeding or severe cramping.</li>
            <li><strong>Under activity</strong> – including missed periods or infertility.</li>
            <li><strong>Distorted activity</strong> – cells that normally line the uterus, implant elsewhere causing bleeding, pain and reduced fertility.</li>
        </ul>

                <figcaption>Encourage someone you know suffering with PMS to give chiropractic a try. An undetected vertebral subluxation may be the culprit.</figcaption>

            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">
                
                <p><strong>While chiropractic care isn’t a treatment for PMS</strong> (or any other condition), many women with spinal distortions have seen an improvement in their reproductive health while under chiropractic care. Restoring a more normally functioning nervous system helps the entire body work the way it’s supposed to.</p>
                
                <p>If you, or someone you love, is put out of commission every month, encourage her to come in for a thorough chiropractic examination. If there’s nerve interference, there’s a good chance we can help.</p>
