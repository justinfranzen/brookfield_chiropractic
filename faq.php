        <h3 class="subheader">Do you take insurance?</h3>
        
        <p>Chiropractic treatment may or may not be covered by your insurance plan. At your first visit with your Brookfield WI chiropractor we will ask you for your insurance information and will call and verify your benefits over the phone.</p>
        
        <h3 class="subheader">How much does it cost?</h3>
        
        <p>The cost of chiropractic treatment with our Brookfield chiropractors is based on your insurance coverage and your condition. After we have confirmed your benefits coverage with your insurance carrier we will go over pricing. This usually is handled at your first visit.</p>
        
         <h3 class="subheader">How long is a typical first visit?</h3>
        
        <p>We usually ask that patients allow thirty minutes to an hour to perform the initial evaluation. This time frame varies from person to person. Click here to find out more about your visits with our Brookfield chiropractors.</p>
        
        <h3 class="subheader">On my first visit will x-rays be taken or will I be adjusted?</h3>
        
        <p>Once you have been seen by the doctor it will be determined based on your condition if x-rays will be taken or you will be adjusted. Each patient’s case is unique and through communication between the patient and Brookfield chiropractors, a care plan will be discussed.</p>
