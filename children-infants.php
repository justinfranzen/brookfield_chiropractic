                 <p>Children are some of the biggest beneficiaries of chiropractic care. Surprised? Those who think of chiropractic as primarily a solution for neck and back problems are surprised to learn that chiropractic can be helpful for many types of childhood health problems.</p>
                
                <h3 class="subheader">Nervous System Disturbances</h3>
                
                 <p>The nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and all the nerves of the body, controls and regulates the entire body. Many childhood health problems are merely the result of nervous system interference, usually along the spine.</p>

                <h3 class="subheader">Chiropractic and Children</h3>

                <p>Upon examination, we often find nerve disturbances associated with many types of common childhood health complaints.</p>
                
                <p>While the effects of these nervous system compromises go by a variety of names, chiropractic is not a treatment for them! Our primary aim is to locate and reduce the underlying nervous system dysfunction.</p>

                <p><strong>Infertility.</strong> Even before birth, restoring nervous system control of reproductive organs has blessed many chiropractic patients with the child they thought was impossible.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Traumatic Birth.</strong> Have your newborn checked shortly after birth to detect the effects of in-utero constraint, C-section, vacuum extraction or other aspects of a stressful birth.</p>
                
            </div>
            
        </div>
    
        <p><strong>Colic.</strong> Birth trauma, even from so-called “natural” birthing experiences can often produce a child’s first nerve compromise. Lacking the ability to communicate, your baby cries. And cries.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Ear infections.</strong> Biomechanical restrictions in the upper spine can compromise the nervous system and immune system, making your child’s ears a breeding ground for viral infection.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bedwetting.</strong> Nervous system compromise in the lower back can block nerve messages responsible for bladder control. Many children regain their confidence and self-esteem with chiropractic care.</p>
        
        <div class="row">
        
             <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">
                 
                 <p><strong>ADHD.</strong> Many parents investigate conservative chiropractic care before exposing their children to psychotropic drugs. Reducing tension to the nervous system has produced excellent results for many.</p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Asthma.</strong> By reducing neurological compromise to the bronchial tubes, lungs and diaphragm with chiropractic care, attacks can often be reduced or eliminated.</p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Growing Pains.</strong> Pain of any type is a warning that something isn’t right. While considered a “phase they’re going through,” it’s usually a sign that biomechanical stress to the nervous system is present.</p>
        
                  <p><strong>Scoliosis.</strong> Instead of crude bracing or the all too common “wait and watch” approach, chiropractic care has helped countless children with this common disfigurement.</p>

        <p><strong>Wellness.</strong> An obvious symptom isn’t required! Enjoy the peace of mind of having your infant or child checked to uncover structural or neurological problems before they become serious.</p>
        
        <p>Many of the hard-to-correct problems we see in adults are long-standing problems that began, and remained undetected in childhood. If you have questions, use the email link below.
