<h1 id="main-header">What Are Vertebral Subluxations?</h1>
    
    <div id="secondary-content">
        
        <p>A vertebral subluxation is the result of spinal bones with improper motion or position affecting nerve communications between your brain and your body..</p>
        
        <div class="row">
            
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">
        
                <p>A vertebral subluxation is a stress response. Muscles go into spasm. Spinal bones lock up. And adjacent nerves are choked or chafed. This interferes with the control and regulation of your body. This garbles communications between the brain and parts of your body.</p>
        
                 <p>Distorted nerve communications can be an underlying cause of many health problems beyond just headaches and back pain. For example, interference with nerve impulses going to or from your stomach: stomach problems.</p>
        
                <p>Your nervous system controls every cell, tissue, organ and system of your body. These nerve impulses travel through your spine. So having a spine free of vertebral subluxations is essential for optimal health.</p>
                
                 <p>Only a chiropractic examination can detect vertebral subluxations. And only chiropractic adjustments can reduce their effect to your nervous system, naturally.</p>
